\definition{Topological space}{  An ordered pair $(X, \tau)$, where $X$ is a set
and $\tau$ is a collection of subsets of $X$, satisfying the following
properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The empty set and $X$ belong to $\tau$
\item Any union of members of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$
\item The intersection of any finite number of members of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$.
\end{enumerate}
The elements of $\tau$ are called \textit{open sets} and $\tau$ is called a
\textit{topology} in $X$.}{A topology is useful to define concepts such as
continuity of functions between topological spaces.}

\definition{Separable space}{ A space is separable iff. there exists a countable
  sequence $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ of elements in the space such that every
  non-empty open subset of the space contains at least one element of the
  sequence. }{Open subsets are required as in some sense, it is not possible to
  make them as small as closed subsets: \eg every non-empty open subset of $\real$
  is uncountable whereas a closed subset can have a single member.}

\definition{Metric space}{
  A set together with a metric defining a distance between any two points in the
  set which satisfies:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item identity of indiscernibles: $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$
  \item symmetry: $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$
  \item triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$
  \end{enumerate}
  }{Positivity of $d(x, y)$ for all $x \neq y$ follows from these conditions.}

  \definition{Complete metric space}{ A metric space M is complete if every
    Cauchy sequence in M has a limit in M. A Cauchy sequence is a sequence $x_1,
    x_2, \ldots$ such that, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N$ such
    that for any $m, n > N$, $d(x_m, x_n) < \epsilon$. }{Intuitively, a space
    with `no points missing'. For example, the real numbers are a complete
    metric space while the rational numbers are incomplete.}

  \definition{Completely metrizable space}{
    A topoological space (X, T) for which there exists a metric d which induces
    the topology T.
